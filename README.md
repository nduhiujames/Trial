Initializing the Repository:

To get started, I opened my terminal and navigated to the desired project directory.
Next, I used the git init command to initialize a new Git repository in that directory.
Creating My Project:

With the repository in place, I created my project by adding files and directories. For example, I created an index.html file and a css directory.
Remote Git Repo Creation:

To establish a remote Git repository, I headed over to GitHub and logged in to my GitHub account.
Then, I clicked the "+" sign in the top right corner and selected "New repository."
I filled in the repository name, description, and other settings as required.
Optionally, I chose whether to make the repository public or private.
Finally, I clicked the "Create repository" button, creating my remote Git repository on GitHub.
